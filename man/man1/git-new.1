.SH DESCRIPTION
Create new branches from the reference branch and push them with
\-\-set\-upstream.

.sp
\fBgit new\fP does the things you really want to safely get new branches
where you can start working and pushing immediately

.sp
\- Fails leaving the workspace unchanged if there are uncommitted changes

.sp
\- Fails if any of the new branches already exists locally or remotely

.sp
\- Fetches the *reference branch* only \- a branch on the upstream or origin repo
  that is the main branch for development \- likely upstream/main or origin/main
  or upstream/master or origin/master

.sp
\- Create new branches locally from that reference branch commit ID

.sp
\- Pushes them to the remote origin with \-\-set\-upstream

.sp
USEFUL FLAGS

.sp
\fBgit new \-\-reference/\-r <branch\-or\-commit>\fP uses a commit ID
to populate the new branches that isn't the default reference branch

.sp
\fBgit new \-\-use\-head/\-u\fP uses the current commit ID to populate the new
branches and not the reference commit

.sp
\fBgit new \-\-duplicate/\-d <remote>/<branch>\fP duplicates the name
and contents of a remote branch in your local repo, super useful for code
reviewing.

.sp
gitz can guess what the reference branch and remote origin are, and for
nearly all projects this will be correct, or this can be specified at the
command line, per project, or through environment variables \- see \fBgit gitz\fP
for more details.
