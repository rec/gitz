SUMMARY = 'Delete one or more branches locally and remotely'

DANGER = 'Deletes remote branches!'

HELP = """
Delete each branch specified together with its remote branch.

By default, branches named `master` and `develop` are protected,
which means they cannot be deleted.

Using the --all/-a flag allows protected branches to be deleted.

It's also possible to change which branches are protected by setting
the environment variable GITZ_PROTECTED_BRANCHES to a list of
branches separated by colons, or to an empty string to turn off
protection entirely.
"""

EXAMPLES = """
git delete foo bar
    Delete the branches foo and bar locally and remotely
"""
