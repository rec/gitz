SUMMARY = 'Delete one or more branches locally and on all remotes'
DANGER = 'Deletes remote branches!'

HELP = """
By default, the branches `master` and `develop` and the remote
`upstream` are protected, which means that they are not allowed
to be delete.

Using the --all/-a flag allows protected branches and remotes
to be deleted.

It's also possible to change which branches or remotes are protected
by setting the environment variable GITZ_PROTECTED_BRANCHES or
GITZ_PROTECTED_REMOTES to a list separated by colons, or to an empty
string to turn off protection entirely.
"""
EXAMPLES = """
git delete foo bar
    Delete the branches foo and bar locally and on every upstream
    except (by default) upstream
