``git copy``: Copy a git branch locally and remotely
----------------------------------------------------

USAGE
=====

.. code-block:: bash

    git copy [-h] [-q] [-v] [-p] [-f] [-n] source [target]

Positional arguments
  ``source``: 
  ``target``: 

Optional arguments
  ``-h, --help``: show this help message and exit

  ``-q, --quiet``: Suppress all output

  ``-v, --verbose``: Report all messages in great detail

  ``-p, --protected``: Copy all, even protected remotes or branches (use -protected to override)

  ``-f, --force``: Force copy over existing branches

  ``-n, --no-run``: If set, commands will be printed but not executed

DESCRIPTION
===========

Copy one branch to another, both locally and in remote
branches.  If no source branch is given, the current branch is
used.

By default, the branches `main`, `master` and `develop`, which means that they
are not allowed to be copied over to.

Using the --all/-a flag allows protected branches to be copied.

It's also possible to override the protected branches by setting the
environment variable GITZ_PROTECTED_BRANCHES to a list separated by colons,
or an empty string for no protection.

DANGER
======

Changes remote branches!

``git copy -f old new``
