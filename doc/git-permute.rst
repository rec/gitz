EXAMPLES

``git permute 10``
``git permute ba``
    Switches the first and second most recent commits

``git permute ab``

``git permute 01``
``git permute 012``
    Do nothing

``git permute cab``
``git permute 201``
    Cycles the three most recent commits so the third one is first

``git permute edcg``
``git permute 5437``
    Deletes the most recent two commeits, reverses the next three, and
    deletes the sixth.

``git permute edcg -s 'My message'``
``git permute edcg --squash='My message'``
``git permute 5437 -s "My message"``
    Same as the previous command, but squashes the three commits into
    one with the commit message 'My message'
